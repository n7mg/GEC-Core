# Green Eco Coin

## _What is GEC_
GEC also called "Green Eco Coin" is experimental digital currency that enables instant, private payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Dash uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. GEC Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the GEC Core software, see _ https://github.com/n7mg/GEC-Core
